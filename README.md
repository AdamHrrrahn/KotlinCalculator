# Overview

{}

This is a basic calculator app with the 4 primary functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. it has support for decimal computation and order of operation control thorugh parentheses.

I used this prject to familiarize myself with the Kotlin language, and to begin to learn about making amobile application in Kotlin

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the androud studio IDE, with an older andoid phone for the testing platform. The foundation for the program was one of the pre-written activites for the IDE that i then modfied with all of hte code reqired to run the caclulator, the base framework for the app being what I kept from the template.

I wrote the program in the Kotlin language, and used components from the kotlin math library.
