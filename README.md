# Development Environment

I used the androud studio IDE, with an older andoid phone for the testing platform. The foundation for the program was one of the pre-written activites for the IDE that i then modfied with all of hte code reqired to run the caclulator, the base framework for the app being what I kept from the template.

I wrote the program in the Kotlin language, and used components from the kotlin math library.
